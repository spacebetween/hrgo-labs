## HR GO Labs Blog



Created using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with the theme based on the MIT licensed theme [Hugo Serif](https://github.com/meersau/hugo-serif-theme). Hosted on Netlify, with auto deployments setup. Any merge or push to the `master` branch will trigger the site to be rebuilt/published - easy peasy.

### Local Setup

On a Mac the easiest was to install Hugo is with homebrew:

```
$ brew install hugo
```

And then run the local development server with the command

```
$ hugo serve
```

This will launch a server hosting the site on http://localhost:1313 and it will auto-rebuild every time you make a change.
