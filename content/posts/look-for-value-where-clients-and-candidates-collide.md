We're lucky. We have two customers: Clients (those with a vacancy) and Candidates (job seekers).

Yet, the bias is usually towards making sure the stakeholder with the money is happy. Given new features for Clients yield new sales, that is where you might look first.

However, now we have interfaces for both customers sorted, the best place to look for value is where single features can be used by both customers:

# Examples

### Job Board
The intersection of Vacancies and Applications:

> As a Client I can submit a description of a vacancy which can be search for by Candidates and 'applied to' so that I can find a suitable Candidate for my vacancy.

> As a Candidate I can search for, view and apply to a description of a vacancy with a Client so that I can be considered for their open vacancy.


### Interview Scheduling
Where Client and Candidate diaries fit together:

> As a Candidate I can book myself into available interview slots with a Client or Recruiter so that I can attend an interview at a mutually convenient time.

> As a Client or Recruiter, I can set times that I am available to interview Candidates and publish them with joining details to my shortlist so that they can book themselves in for an interview.

### Planner
Where Candidates set their availability and Clients add their vacancies

> As a Client I can add vacancies and the details thereof where I can view a diary of those vacancies and their current status so that I can place orders, see progress and track fulfilment.

> As a Candidate I can maintain my availability for work and view, accept or reject bookings offered to me so that I can find opportunities to work and see the details of my bookings.

### Timesheets

Where Candidates submit their timesheets for Client approval

> As a Candidate I can input the hours I work each day for Client approval so that I can be paid for the work I have done.

> As a Client I can review timesheets submitted to me before approving them so that I can ensure I am billed correctly for the work done.

# Conclusion

Where demands from all stakeholders is for a better, modern, digital experience, we must look for opportunities to deliver the maximum amount of value as rapidly as possible. Areas where features deliver value to multiple stakeholders are where our efforts will be focussed in the short term, as it helps us achieve this.

Do you have any ideas where we could deliver value to multiple stakeholders with single features?

What parts of the recruitment process suck for both Clients and Candidates today?
