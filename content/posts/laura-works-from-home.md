When John told me to inform the Labs team to pack up tools and start working from home, it was with a heavy heart I shut down my laptop and packed up everything bar the kitchen sink.  

Anyone who knows me, knows I am a people person. I love being around people, talking to people, having face to face meetings and therefore the prospect of working from home for the indefinite future did fill me with a little bit of fear, anxiety and dread to a certain degree. 

I am used to working from home once maybe every 3 – 4 weeks and don’t get me wrong, when I do, I get so much done and I feel on top of my workload once again.  However, I knew this wasn’t going to be a one off.   

My anxiety wasn’t due to a fear of work not getting completed or my team not being able to perform to their usual high level; as John wrote in a previous blog post we have every tool and process in place to enable working from home to be as seamless as if we were in the office; it is simply a fear of isolation and loneliness. 

I live on my own and therefore knew that there wouldn’t be anyone bustling around in my flat, it would simply be just me and my only human contact would be potentially with the postman when he drops another bill or package off, standing 2 metres away from me! 

I decided to not dwell on my concerns and try and embrace this new way of working.  The Labs team have stand up every day at 9.30am and that’s a welcomed piece of contact with my team.  As well as getting to test that my voice is working for the day, I also get to catch up on what everyone is working on and that usually culminates in tasks for myself that can take up the rest of my morning in some circumstances.   

I am a massive fan of Slack, and it is a central tool to the Labs way of working and I am usually talking to someone on it at most points throughout the day.  Even though we mainly use it for messaging, I still feel so connected with people even though I can’t hear or see them.  Our Gif usage also makes for many giggles. 

Jira is my bible and one of my screens alone will be dedicated to Jira, and even being able to see the tickets the guys are working on and seeing them move their way through the various statuses makes me yet again feel connected to my team.   

I also implemented ‘Coffee catch up’ each day with the team at 3.30pm (thanks for the certificate John!) This is where we all get on a call and just have a chat about life, share funny stories and discuss what we are having for dinner that night.  It brings a welcomed 10 minutes of normality in what feels like a very abnormal time right now.   

I also decided to embrace this time as an opportunity to turn my spare room into an office, so off I went to Argos (before lockdown and they were all sold out, I hastened to add) to purchase a new desk and chair, that I am very proud to say I put together all by myself!  I really wanted to try and create a separate living to work area as I think it's important that in my case, my lounge/kitchen didn’t become somewhere I spend every single waking hour.  It is really nice now to shut the door on my spare room after a day of working and go into my lounge with no visual association to work, so I can then relax.   

After reading many top tip articles on working from home, I wholeheartedly agree about continuing to perform your normal morning routine.  It could be so easy to just roll out of bed at 8.58am switch the laptop on and stay in your pyjamas all day however psychologically this just doesn’t work for me.  My current morning routine consists of either the Joe Wicks PE lesson from the day before or a run, (as trying to find the motivation in the evening is near on impossible), shower and then get dressed (not in quite the normal work attire I would usually wear in the office but something other than pj’s!) For me, it sets me up for the day and I feel in the right mindset to crack on with work.   

I try and take regular breaks from my desk to stretch my legs however my legs seem to stretch towards the kitchen, mainly ending up at the fridge or the biscuit tin...any tips on how to stop this happening would be welcome, all I seem to do is eat! 

I use my lunch hour to pop out for some fresh air or simply do some household chores.  It's important to step away from the computer as per you normally would if you were taking a lunch when in the office.   

Overall, these first few weeks working from home haven’t been as bad as I was potentially anticipating. Ensuring my environment was suitable for the long term helped and remaining in a regular, similar routine to normal was a welcome, familiar feeling, removing potential anxiety.   Knowing the team are only a phone call or slack message away definitely helps and having our 2 regular catch ups in the day reduces that sense of loneliness.   

It also helps there is lots and lots to be getting on with, so in some ways I feel closer to my team and colleagues than ever before.  There are so many calls and emails flying around due to the various tasks that the Labs team are involved in and it also helps knowing our work will support HR GO and our clients get through this uncertain time.
