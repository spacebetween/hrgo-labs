Hello Everyone!

My name is Joanna! I have joined HR GO on 1st September 2021. 
I am 28, a self-taught programmer from Wroclaw, Poland, and currently based in Manchester.

I have lived in the UK for almost 2 years but it feels like only a few months because of the pandemic.

I am a very positive person, tolerant and open to new experiences, unless you propose to feed a lion dressed as an antelope :joy:.

When it comes to my goals, I would like to see as much of the world as possible, adopt a dog, develop my skills as a programmer and improve my english. When I am retired I want to open a shelter for animals in my garden.

I am very happy that I have joined the team and that I can work with such wonderful people.

Cheers!
