Hello Everyone!

My name is Joanna! I have joined HR GO on 1st September 2021.
I am 28, from Wroclaw, Poland, and currently based in Manchester.
I am a very positive person, tolerant and open to new experiences, unless you propose to feed a lion dressed as an antelope ðŸ˜‚.

When it comes to my goals, I would like to see as much of the world as possible, adopt a dog, develop my skills as a programmer and improve my english.
I am very happy that I have joined the team and that I can work with such wonderful people.

Cheers!
