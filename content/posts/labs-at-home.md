We've cleared out of The Cedars and headed home.

Yesterday Boris Johnson told all of us in the UK that we should avoid contact with other people if possible. So, like millions of others, we have headed home to set up to carry on working on our projects.

Fortunately, with the tools we use and the processes we follow, this shouldn't impact negatively on our productivity. So, I wanted to write this post to share how we'll be working at home.

# Tools

### Jira
https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira

Our project management tool of choice is Jira. We track the progress of our projects here and keep track of requirements. When working remotely it's important to us that we keep this system up to date so that we can share status and communicate.

### Slack
https://slack.com/

We chat to each other on Slack, both with text messages and with video calls. This is where we share thoughts and information in a way which is easy to access and doesn't interrupt 'flow' in the same way a phone call would. Notwithstanding it being a business tool, it's also a place where we can joke around and keep up to date with each other as we would over a cup of tea in the office.

### GitHub
https://github.com/

Code and code reviews happen on GitHub. We send our work here throughout the day and can pull down each otherâ€™s work for review or collaboration. We also conduct our code reviews on this platform before we deploy code to production.

# Processes

### Daily Stand-up

Like many development teams we take 15 minutes at the start of each day to take a look over our tickets and answer the following questions:

- What did I work on yesterday?
- What am I working on today?
- What is getting in the way of me making progress?

And, given the constant changes around us with Coronavirus:

- What's happening in the wider Company
- How can we stay safe

This daily meeting is a chance for us to prepare for the day and share challenges that other team members can help with.

### Agile

We work in sprints at Labs. We take some problems we want to solve and organise them into tickets we can complete in bursts of two weeks. This is helpful to us in working from home and in times of shifting priorities because we've not got a never-ending list of tasks to do but can take decisions to shift our focus to projects that will have the most impact at the time.

An example of this is that we're focussing on shipping our timesheets feature so that clients and workers can approve and authorise timesheets within our platform. We hope it might make life a little bit easier in difficult times.

### Coffee Time with Laura

A new addition to our processes is "Coffee Time with Laura". A new initiative proposed by 'the backbone of our team' where we will take 10 minutes out of our afternoon to chat about what's going on in our lives.

Typically, you would have conversations like this in the office but with the lack of human contact in working from home this is a good opportunity for us to feel less isolated and more human.

We'll have to find a certificate for Laura for 'best Coronavirus idea'. She'll be happy.

# Finally

Stay safe out there.

My Dad says to me 'every problem is an opportunity in disguise'. Working from home gives us an opportunity to focus more than we might be able to in the office and the right tools ensure we're still 'plugged in'.

Let's see if we can be productive, creative and connected, even at home.
