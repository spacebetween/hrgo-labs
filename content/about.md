When Space Between merged with Eclipse late last year, it made more sense for those of Space Between who worked solely on looking after the HR GO sites and applications to join HR GO rather than Eclipse.  In this exciting move, the HR GO Labs team was created!

The Labs team, headed up by John includes 3 developers; Michael, Matt and James and Laura as Project Manager.

The Labs team are responsible for creating and maintaining the various websites that come under the HR GO brand and applications such as Branch App, Members Area and Client Portal.  

In order to ensure HR GO stands head and shoulders above the rest, the Labs team aim to use the latest and relevant technology to help make sure the recruitment process for client, candidate and consultant is as smooth and effective as possible. They are constantly working on maintaining and improving our current technology to guarantee it is of the best quality, whilst working on new and innovative digital products that will make the world of recruitment for all those involved, as dynamic, exciting and easy as it can be. 

As the people who are using the technology on a daily basis and are in constant contact with candidates and clients the Labs team would love to hear from you as to your thoughts and ideas for improving the digital aspect of HR GO; so please do get in touch with any of them to discuss your suggestions.
